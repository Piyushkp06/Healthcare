## 🩺 Example: MCP Server Usage

1. **Doctor types prescription** in the frontend
2. **Frontend sends input** to MCP server via WebSocket
3. **MCP server responds** with smart suggestions (e.g., drug names, dosages)
4. **Doctor selects suggestion** or continues typing
5. **Prescription is validated** and saved via backend API
