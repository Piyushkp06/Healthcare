**1. Assessment:** Likely Hypertensive Crisis superimposed on Essential Hypertension with possible end-organ damage (based on BP 150/95, severe headache, nausea, shortness of breath). Urgent evaluation is required.

**2. Prescribed Treatment:**

*   **Hold** Amlodipine 5mg QD and Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg QD *temporarily*, pending evaluation and further instructions.  *Do not discontinue these medications permanently without consulting a physician.*
*   **Immediate:** Go to the nearest Emergency Department (ER) or call 911 for evaluation and management of hypertensive crisis.

**3. Important Considerations:**

*   **Critical Warning:** Blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg with the current symptoms (severe headache, nausea, shortness of breath) necessitates *immediate* evaluation to rule out end-organ damage (e.g., stroke, heart attack, kidney damage). *Do not delay seeking care.*
*   **Headache:** The severe headache could be related to dangerously elevated blood pressure or another underlying cause requiring immediate investigation.
*   **Nausea & Shortness of Breath:** These symptoms, in the context of elevated blood pressure, raise concern for cardiac involvement or other complications.
*   **Medication Interactions:** Many OTC medications (cold remedies, pain relievers) can worsen hypertension. Avoid taking any new medications before assessment by a physician.
*   **Possible Side Effects:** The patient should be monitored for possible side effects of previously prescribed meds when labs are drawn at emergency room.

**4. Follow-up:**

*   **ER Visit:** Follow all instructions given by the ER physician.
*   **Primary Care Physician (PCP):** Schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician within 1-2 days *after* the ER visit to review ER findings and adjust long-term management of hypertension.
*   **Further Evaluation:** Be prepared for potential further evaluation (e.g., EKG, blood tests, imaging) as determined by the ER physician and your PCP. Discuss the possibility of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) with your PCP.

**Rationale:** Given the patient's elevated blood pressure reading in conjunction with severe headache, nausea, and shortness of breath, a hypertensive emergency must be ruled out. Temporarily holding the current medications is advised until the patient has been appropriately assessed in the ER setting. This prescription prioritizes patient safety and prompt intervention to mitigate potential complications.
